* Description

Mostly object-oriented exceptions: throw them (as objects, to your taste);
catch them (by class if desired); run finally blocks; etc.

This is experimental and in transition; I have just taken it over from
P. Seibel and am making interface changes.

This module will probably disappear when exception-handling is integrated into
the core, or becomes a standard facility somehow.
